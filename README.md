# Temperature-Sensing-using-Contiki-OS---Final-Project-Report
This project demonstrates a temperature sensing application developed using Contiki OS, an operating system designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). Using the in-built temperature sensors of simulation tools like Cooja, the project collects temperature data and demonstrates communication between nodes in a sensor network.
